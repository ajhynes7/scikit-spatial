Plotting
--------

This library uses ``matplotlib`` to enable plotting of all of its spatial objects. Each object has a ``plot_2d`` and/or ``plot_3d`` method. For example, a :class:`Point` object can be plotted in 2D or 3D, while a :class:`Sphere` object can only be plotted in 3D.

The ``matplotlib`` dependency is optional. To install it, you can install scikit-spatial with the extra `plotting`.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install scikit-spatial[plotting]


The ``plot_2d`` methods require an instance of :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` as the first argument, while the ``plot_3d`` methods require an instance of :class:`~mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D`. This allows for placing multiple spatial objects on the same plot, which is useful for visualizing computations such as projection or intersection.

The methods also pass keyword arguments to ``matplotlib`` functions. For example, ``Point.plot_2d`` uses :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter` under the hood, so any keyword arguments to :meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter` can also be input to the method. Some plotting methods have additional keyword arguments that are not passed to ``matplotlib``, such as ``Line.plot_2d``, which takes parameters ``t_1`` and ``t_2`` to determine the start and end points of the line.


Let's project a 2D point onto a 2D line and plot the result with ``plot_2d`` methods.

.. plot::
   :include-source:

   >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   >>> from skspatial.objects import Point, Line

   >>> point = Point([0, 5])
   >>> line = Line(point=[0, 0], direction=[1, 1])

   >>> point_projected = line.project_point(point)

   >>> _, ax = plt.subplots()

   >>> line.plot_2d(ax, t_2=5, c='k')

   >>> point.plot_2d(ax, s=50)
   >>> point_projected.plot_2d(ax, c='r', s=50, zorder=3)

   >>> limits = ax.axis('equal')


For convenience, the ``skspatial.plotting`` module contains ``plot_2d`` and ``plot_3d`` functions as well. These functions can place an arbitrary number of spatial objects on the same plot so that ``matplotlib`` doesn't need to be imported directly. All spatial objects have a ``plotter`` method which is simply used to bundle keyword arguments for the ``plot_2d`` or ``plot_3d`` methods.

Let's make the same plot as before with the ``plot_2d`` function. The function returns the standard ``matplotlib`` figure and axes objects so the plot can be easily customized.


.. plot::
   :include-source:

   >>> from skspatial.objects import Point, Line
   >>> from skspatial.plotting import plot_2d

   >>> point = Point([0, 5])
   >>> line = Line(point=[0, 0], direction=[1, 1])

   >>> point_projected = line.project_point(point)

   >>> _, ax = plot_2d(
   ...   point.plotter(s=50),
   ...   point_projected.plotter(c='r', s=50, zorder=3),
   ...   line.plotter(t_2=5, c='k'),
   ... )

   >>> limits = ax.axis('equal')
